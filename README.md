<p align="center"><i>Undervalued Films is not complete at this time. I am currently encountering 2 problems:</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>1) Implementing the algorithm into the list so that the lsit reshuffles according to user inputs</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>2) Passing the data that users input into the database.</i></p>

<p align="center"><i>If you have any suggestions or know anyone who might be able to solve these last 2 problems, feel free to get in contact with me.</i></p>

<p align="center">Undervalued Films was founded in 2023 and is a web platform for a community of film enthusiasts who recommend films that they feel are undervalued to each other in order to give those films the appreciation they deserve.</p>

<p align="center">Users are able to recommend any film that hasn’t already been recommended by the community, make as many film recommendations as they wish, can rate whether or not they have heard of the film before coming to the site and can rate the quality of each film between 1 to 5 stars.</p>

<p align="center">All of these contributions from the community influence The Film List, a list of all the films recommended by the community, in order of how undervalued the film is. The more undervalued a film is the higher up the list it will land and the less undervalued a film is the lower it will find itself on the list.</p>

<p align="center">But what makes this list different is that as users seek out and watch the more undervalued films, the films at the top of the list, and rate the quality of those films on the site, those films will find their way down the list as they’re finally gaining more and more appreciation. This reshuffling of the list always gives users more undervalued films to seek out and watch, constantly encouraging users to discover films that they might not have heard of otherwise.</p>
